# 🚀 Getting Started with Machine Learning

## Welcome! Let's Begin Your ML Journey

This guide will help you set up and start your first ML project.

## 📋 Prerequisites Check

Make sure you have:
- ✅ Python installed (you're already set!)
- ✅ Virtual environment activated
- ✅ Libraries installed (scikit-learn, numpy, pandas)

## 🛠️ Environment Setup

Your environment is already set up! You can verify by running:

```bash
python --version
pip list | grep -E "(numpy|pandas|scikit-learn)"
```

## 🎯 Your First Project: Hello ML World

Let's start with something simple - a basic data analysis script.

### Step 1: Create Your First Script

Navigate to the projects directory and create your first script:

```python
# hello_ml.py - Your first ML script
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Create some sample data
data = {
    'feature1': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'feature2': [2, 4, 6, 8, 10],
    'target': [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print("Your first dataset:")
print(df)

# Basic statistics
print("\nBasic statistics:")
print(df.describe())

# Simple numpy operations
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(f"\nNumPy array: {arr}")
print(f"Mean: {arr.mean()}")
print(f"Standard deviation: {arr.std()}")
```

### Step 2: Run Your Script

```bash
cd projects/week1_numpy
python hello_ml.py
```

## 📚 Next Steps

1. **Complete the script above** and run it
2. **Read the ML Learning Roadmap** in `ML_Learning_Roadmap.md`
3. **Start with Week 1** from the roadmap
4. **Document your progress** as you go

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Start small:** Don't try to learn everything at once
- **Practice daily:** Even 30 minutes a day adds up
- **Experiment:** Modify examples and see what happens
- **Ask questions:** Don't hesitate to ask for help
- **Keep a journal:** Note what you learn each day

## 🎉 You're Ready!

You've taken the first step into the exciting world of Machine Learning. Remember, every expert was once a beginner. Take it one concept at a time, and you'll be building amazing projects before you know it!
