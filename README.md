## 🎯 Current Status

- ✅ Environment setup complete
- ✅ Core libraries installed (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, etc.)
- ✅ Learning roadmap created
- ✅ Project structure organized
- ✅ First script working

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Activate environment:**
   ```bash
   source my-project-env/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Run your first script:**
   ```bash
   cd projects/week1_numpy
   python hello_ml.py
   ```

3. **Follow the roadmap:**
   - Read `ML_Learning_Roadmap.md` for detailed curriculum
   - Check `Getting_Started.md` for immediate next steps
   - Work through projects week by week

## 📚 Learning Approach

- **Practical First:** Hands-on projects every week
- **Progressive:** Build complexity gradually
- **Comprehensive:** Cover theory + implementation
- **Portfolio Building:** Create deployable projects

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.13**
- **NumPy** - Numerical computing
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine learning algorithms
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** - Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Interactive development
